# tons-of-tacos-v1.3

## This application is based off of the [tons-of-tacos](https://github.com/strauberly/tons-of-tacos) project I created earlier. And is meant as a portfolio project in order to demonstrate some of my capability and comprehension as junior fullstack developer to potential employers.

## The prior application was a more simplistic command line application created to demonstrate logic solving and core Java knowledge. This version will be a fullstack application that feels as though Tons of Tacos actually exists.

## Tons of Tacos is a fictional food truck. This is an application designed for its owners and their customers in order to expedite the ordering process and increase sales.

## Progress can be monitored from the [Dev-Journal](https://github.com/strauberly/tons-of-tacos-v1.3/blob/main/DEV-JOURNAL.md).

## Thank you for checking out what I am working on!

### I. General Design Specs

- Focus is on getting functionality in place for customers to place orders. Then
  they can just come down to the truck pay in person and pick up food. After this
  we will implement accepting online payments and additional features.

- Create front-end with a focus on ease of use, and reflective of owners open,
  kind, and hard working nature. Food has a folk with modern flair vibe.

- Create API whose primary focus will be retrieving menu items from a MySQL
  database in order to create an order.
  Additional functionality at some point likely to also include:

  - Allow the food truck owners to update and edit their menu, orders, and track
    sales.

  - Allow a customer to create an account where they may have access to special
    deals and menu items. Also view past orders and repeat them in order to
    facilitate expedient orders if desired.

  - Allow owners to enter food truck location in order to be displayed on a map.

- Build an owners portal into the front-end to facilitate owners ability to work
  with orders and customers.
