Tons of Tacos is a fictional food truck company that requested a web application to increase the amount of sales they could process in a set time frame. 

Traditionally a busy food truck can be bogged down with customers milling about in front of the truck deciding what they want and then going through the ordering process. With this application the menu can be viewed and orders placed remotely.

We got our start in the world flipping homes for profit. Over time, we realized a negative impact this was having on affordable housing in our community and decided to switch gears. 

We sold off our portfolio to first time buyers for cost except for one. We converted that property into a small scale farm we use to create the ingredients for our food we love to share with others.

Our passion for delicious, wholesome, satisfying meals is matched by watching folks come together at a table to enjoy those meals and we love catering for group functions and being a part of folks special events.

Thank you for selecting us to provide you with delicious fuel to get you through a busy day. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to enhance your experience.

Love,

Brian and Jess Castillo
