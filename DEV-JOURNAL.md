Started off new year with completion of a quick next.js refresher and beginning work on the front end.

- project initialized and example scrub.
- created images folder and loaded up with menu item images.
- created a components folder.
- created error and not found pages.
- began throwing in placeholders for styling.
- Updated README.

Off to the races!

---

--- 1 Dec 2023 ---

- Created site design mockups using logos and color schemes. See below.
- Gathered and resized images to be used with our menu items.
- Initialized Next.js application in front-end folder.
- Will start get images into public asset folder and then update backend with correct paths for the images.

### Sample Mock Ups For Consideration

Spent time refining logo designs (included below).

Next steps to include:

- landing page mockups
- gathering and formatting remaining menu item images

- Created wire frame demonstrating action to add a menu item to cart. More or less created to demonstrate knowledge of design life cycle and demonstrate how I might convey that information to others. I may create more for additional actions as time allows in the future but am chomping at the bit to get moving on development.

---

--- 3 Nov 2023 ---

- Began creating color templates, logo concept art, and wire frames. Below are a few samples. Will begin work on wire frames for task flows (ie. Selecting menu items and submitting an order, owner login and various tasks.) next.

---

-- 10 Oct 2023 --

Had a drive fail and lost a bit of work but was able to get drive cloned and then utilize git to repair damaged files merged from a cloned drive. Both drives appear to be synced and operational and program is chugging along. Next steps will include a cleanup from the file repairs.

---

-- 5 Oct 2023 --

- tests refactored and improved upon.
- noticed double data type utilized in application to describe currency variables. Updated to utilize big decimal instead for precision.

---

-- 3 Oct 2023 --

- Application wide refactor mostly focused on eliminating outdated comments and commenting out print lines in order to reduce noise. Commented out instead of eliminated as I appreciate not having to completely rewriting the line when trouble shooting is required.

---

-- 25 Sep 2023 --

- Updated all endpoint documentation for swagger with more detailed instructions and examples.
- Began work on tests with Mockito. Utilizing the framework to mock null instances of calls to the database and ensure global exception handler is operating as desired. These tests will serve as a refactor and replacement of earlier tests.

---

-- 13 Sep 2023 --

- Discovered bug linked to not enough variation in path names to differentiate between searching for a customer or order by uid or customer name. Appears to be remedied by adding uid or name to the paths concerned.

  (ie "/get-order-uid/{orderUid}", "/get-order-customer/{customer}")

---

-- 11 Sep 2023 --

- Updates to owners tools pertaining to customers for increased validation.

---

-- 10 Sep 2023 --

- Refactored dtos to exclude entities id in favor of uid and for returned order to utilize uids in lieu of ids.
- Updated owners tools customers requests to make use of uids.
- Encountered a bug while returning customer by name that appeared to stem from endpoint paths too similar to looking up a customer by uid. Rectified through alteration to naming convention.

---

-- 06 Sep 2023 --

- Delete order tests updated to make use of order uid.
- Edit order item quantity tests updated to make use of order uid.

---

-- 04 Sep 2023 --

- Initialized refactor of order endpoints to use the order uid in lieu of the order database index as a parameter for searches and alterations by the owner.
- Mark an order as ready changed from id to uid successfully. Will continue on with additional changes.

---

-- 1 Aug 2023 --

- Refactored for 401 responses for bad login attempt or trying to send request with fabricated payload.
- Removed a validation check that was hindering auth filter.
- Next steps will include a refactor of security files to remove redundant comments or theoretical code.

---

---

-- 11 Jul 2023 --

- Encountered oddities while running test cases through postman in exception handling for un-found menu item entities. These have been resolved.
- Junit tests performing as expected for exception handling.
- Application test run through postman successful.
- Commencing clean up and refactor.

---

-- 6 Jul 2023 --

- Currently all 44 tests for input and output validation operating as expected for all current customer and owner functions. Whew!
- Next will be quick run through with postman to verify user experience followed by a refactor and clean up.

---

-- 5 Jul 2023 --

- Test for daily sales through postman reveals logic errors. Needs to be evaluated further.
- Need to edit response successful deletion of an order. Currently returning void.

---

-- 4 Jul 2023 --

- mark order ready and mark order closed refactored to return order dto.
- Moving onto daily sales. Dto to be created, returned and verified. Test will include marking two orders ready and closed in order to test calculations.

### To all that remains of freedom and liberty.

---

-- 3 Jul 2023 --

- Negative test case for attempt to close an order with an invalid order id complete.
- Negative test case for attempt to close an order before the order has been marked ready complete.

---

-- 2 Jul 2023 --

- Negative test cases for editing an order item quantity complete.
- Negative test case for no orders returned complete.
- Negative test case for calling an order by a bad order id complete.
- Negative test case for calling an order by an invalid uid complete.
- Negative test case for calling an order by an invalid customer name complete.
- Negative test case for attempting to change order status with invalid order id complete.
- Positive test case for closing an order complete.

---

-- 29 Jun 2023 --

- Completed validation for adding an item to an order, handling an exception and tests for negative use case.
- Completed validation for deleting an order, handling an exception and tests for negative use case.
- Began validation for editing an order item. Still need test for changing quantity to zero and being removed from the order .

---

-- 28 Jun 2023 --

- Completed validation for adding an item to an order, handling an exception and tests for negative use case.
- Completed validation for deleting an order, handling an exception and tests for negative use case.
- Began validation for editing an order item. Still need test for changing quantity to zero and being removed from the order .

---

-- 27 Jun 2023 --

- Previously mentioned bug appears to be just that. Tried printing caught exception from repository and then commented it out and then new exception properly thrown and picked up. Seems a tad bizarre.
- Completed negative test cases for updating customer email.
- Completed negative test cases for updating customer phone number.
- Bug now appears to be as a result of needing to be instantiated (ie in the call to print customer) before the exception is thrown.
- Tests for owners functions pertaining to customers completed including validation.

---

-- 26 Jun 2023 --

- Implemented new tests for bad test cases for all owner functions relating to customers except update email and phone.
- Something bizarre with trying to call the repository to verify a customer id. Like it didn't close the connection properly.
- Will investigate further.

---

-- 20 Jun 2023 --

- Implemented new test for bad test case for delete customer by id.
- Implemented changes to get all customers for a more thorough test.

---

-- 19 Jun 2023 --

- Completed test for request sent with jwt containing invalid subject.
- Next phase will include verifying that all tests have a negative test case with expected exceptions thrown starting with delete customer by id.

---

-- 13 Jun 2023 --

- Began laying new jwt validation tests.
- Confirmed that if token expiration is before issued at jwt expiration exception thrown. Same as other test case where date is fixed as expired.
- Next will test where username or signature are invalid.

---

-- 12 Jun 2023 --

Something odd has taken place. Application and all tests were functioning as desired but something changed recently causing bearer token to not be generated so need to go back and and start at the root before further progress can be made towards testing for proper exception handling of bad jwts.

- Research reveals one version of auth filter allows for successful token creation but not allowing for successful error handling, the other version allows for error handling but not successful token creation.

- Removal of :

        assert expiration != null;

        if (!issuedAt.before(expiration)){
            throw new JwtException("invalid date") ;
        }

Appears to have rectified the issue.

- I believe the next endeavors will include cloning aspects of the jwt class in for our other test cases.

---

-- 7 Jun 2023 --

Still experimenting with where I want to catch certain errors and what makes most sense but completed test for an expired jwt. Next test will be for a jwt that isnt yet expired but the expiration is before the issued at.

---

-- 6 Jun 2023 --

Finally broke through. Moved auth filter in security config to the top of the stack, implemented suggestions from Nicolas Francisco Corvi and additional documentation to incorporate a Handler Exception Resolver, and also added a lombok config file in order to make it work.

Excited for this step and looking forward to the next.

---

-- 2 Jun 2023 --

- Bit stumped on getting global error handler to pick up exceptions related to jwt validation. Have submitted a question on stack trace to see if I can get more info from development community et al.

- Next attempts to include experimenting with catching the exception in a service layer, mostly out of curiosity.
- Continuing on current trajectory of customer exception for each jwt use case(seems inefficient in theory but seems to be best chance so far)
- As well, will re-attempt authentication entry point implementation and creating a returnable error response.

---

-- 29 May 2023 --

- Exception was being handled though not correctly. New efforts have demonstrated a more desirable result. Error code is correctly returned as well as the ability to manipulate the response into a useable message. This is not yet the full desired effect of having the exception picked up and handled by the global error handler. Morning research has brought me the following resource for further research.

https://github.com/erickrodrigs/musicflux/commit/c247e7f9212560c5f3e19c5b8667d7e97e22309f

---

-- 24 May 2023 --

- Research indicate jwt exceptions are coming from filter which is why the global error handler established is so far unable to pick up and handle the exception. Have been looking over other developers solutions and believe I may have located a jumping off point for a solution.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34595605/how-to-manage-exceptions-thrown-in-filters-in-spring

---

-- 23 May 2023 --

- Narrowing down relationship between jwt auth filter and extract all claims method. Specifically parseClaimsJws needs more understanding. Application is currently correctly throwing an expired jwt exception for our test data and returning a 403 but our exception is not currently being appropriately handled and returning useful information to the front end.

---

-- 22 May 2023 --

- While working through validating tokens it has been discovered that signature exceptions are being thrown but not handled. Research has lead me to the auth filter. I will be focused on this for a bit trying to achieve desired results. So I am currently advising to consider the auth filter a mess until further notice while tearing it apart and putting it back together. ^\_^.

---

-- 18 May 2023 --

- Began laying out procedures for tests concerning owner functions.
- Also need to take a look at when tests are run in succession there is a repeating pattern of 1 fail and two pass, 2 fail and one pass, and all pass. This behavior appears to mostly originate in the bad password test. My hunch is that something is related to the random chars created for encryption.
  - Will look into excluding specific chars. Will start with (", ^, <, >).

---

-- 17 May 2023 --

- Test case for an unsuccessful login attempt with a bad username returning a 401 successful and in place. Seems to be a spring bug with a fair bit of history. Solution came from research and after attempting multiple possibilities. The following dependency resolved the issue.

      	<groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents.client5</groupId>
      	<artifactId>httpclient5</artifactId>
      	<version>5.2.1</version>
      	<scope>test</scope>

- Nest step will be replicating test for a correct username but bad password.
- Bad password test successfully tests for 401 and error message contains the appropriate fields.

---

-- 16 May 2023 --

- Invalid credentials test is accurately looking for whatever response code is determined. Currently application throws a 403 if login fails and desired effect is a 401 for a bad login and then a 403 if a user was to say try and access a function with a bad jwt. Will attempt try catch at auth service for resolution.

---

-- 15 May 2023 --

- Continuing with bad login and validation tests.

---

-- 11 May 2023 --

- Began laying out negative test case for login endpoint.

---

-- 10 May 2023 --

- Updated createOrder() to reset validation flags after an order is saved.
- Updated database and entity to use status instead of closed as a data column for an order. Should make data more digestible. By default status is set as "open" and when order is closed will now read "Closed : + timestamp".
- Create order tests reformat completed at the moment.

---

-- 9 May 2023 --

- Order validation refactored for a clean up and integration test for negative test case operating as expected.
- Valid order test refactored for updated validation and is successful.
- Cleaned up code and comments in auth service, order creation test, and jwt service.

---

-- 8 May 2023 --

- customer email validation in place.
- test correctly returns 400 bad request if customer name, phone number or email invalid.

---

-- 4 May 2023 --

- validateCustomerName method implemented and functioning as intended.
- validateCustomerPhoneNumber method implemented and functioning as intended.

---

-- 3 May 2023 --

- Valid order test updated as well as orders service incorporating validation for a customer name.
- Research lead to regex solution from user Nick Sikrier on stack overflow https://dev.library.kiwix.org/content/stackoverflow_en_nopic_2021-08/questions/15805555/java-regex-to-validate-full-name-allow-only-spaces-and-letters.

  - solution as  ^\\p{L}+[\p{L}\p{Pd}\p{Zs}']\\\*\p{L}+\$|^\p{L}+$

    - ^\p{L}+ &nbsp; - &nbsp; It should start with 1 or more letters.
    - [\p{Pd}\p{Zs}'\p{L}]\* &nbsp; - &nbsp; It can have letters, space character (including invisible), dash or hyphen characters and ' in any order 0 or more times.
    - \p{L}+$ &nbsp; - &nbsp; It should finish with 1 or more letters.
    - |^\p{L}+$ &nbsp; - &nbsp; Or it just should contain 1 or more letters (It is done to support single letter names).

- My addition and incorporation simply adds converting our received customer name from the order, converting to a byte array and counting how many spaces. So if the name format doesnt match regex or has too many or not enough spaces it will not be valid. Nick's above regex allows any letter in any language and may be overkill for our little local food truck, but thought it might be nice to have the option. To be evaluated if issues arise.
- The idea being that front end should receive customer first and last name trimmed and then concat with a single space in between. Will be noted in the documentation.
- Added skeleton methods to order service to hold validation means for an order in order to help increase readability.

---

-- 2 May 2023 --

- Created test for negative use case of creating and verifying validation is operating as desired.

- Fine tuning regex.

---

-- 1 May 2023 --

- Validation in place for returning a menu item by id, or menu items by category. Tests updated for positive and negative use cases.
- Initialization of laying out validation for creating an order. Most likely evaluating that each field for customer is not null and of valid type, as well as ensuring order is not nut and the total is reflective of the cost of each item in the order.

---

-- 27 Apr 2023 --

- Quite possibly found my solution through simple creation of a body field returned in create message field. The actual error itself will be logged through the creation of a log method called in the error handler.
- Error handler updated for number format exception and entity not found exception.
- Menu item test successful for positive and negative use test cases.

---

-- 26 Apr 2023 --

- Development has slowed dramatically due to returning to old job in order to pay bills while trying to change careers.
- Working at trying to create a more detailed form of feed back for front end development when an exception is encountered.

---

--- 21 Apr 2023 --

- Appear to have rectified algorithm for random Uid generated on order creation
- Create order gives us a return order dto for order confirmation.
- Test successful however dtos were not being set correctly for response message but now are.
- Test is satisfactory.
- Order generates uid correctly on order creation.

---

-- 20 Apr 2023 --

- Beginning implementation of generating a random uid for an order on checkout.
- Trying for a smaller number so easy to read and repeat to customer or owner.

---

-- 19 Apr 2023 --

- Tests functioning as desired after encryption implementation for both username and password. This would indicate a means for protection from MITM. Algorithm can always be improved.
- Encryption algorithm keys moved offsite.
- Development code cleaned and saved offsite to my files for proof of work if requested but so that old algorithm views are not sitting waiting to be picked up.

---

-- 18 Apr 2023 --

- Basic implementation of encryption and decryption created
- Discovered char being generated causes issue with json string
- Research into random int generation with exclusions

---

-- 6 Apr 2023 --

- Refactored files pertaining to security.
- Functionality tested in postman.
- Mapping out integration tests and means for token refresh and invalidation of token.

---

-- 5 Apr 2023 --

- Corrected circular dependencies.
- Application is correctly locking off desired endpoints and granting access if a valid jwt accompanies the request in the header and is only created if entered credentials for the owners match in the database.

---

-- 4 Apr 2023 --

- Jwtauth filter in place for validation by user name and date.
- Refactored -> past implementation generated token but would token was not accepted. Possibly due to time lited in postman vs. the amount of time before expiration.
- Current state creates toke. It is apparently accepted with a 200 but further testing is required still as we are no longer receive the expected objects back in postman accessing the secured endpoint.
- Returning a 200 for the token passing the filter but request not continuing on past to the endpoint. Next will include feedback for each step and comparing passing nothing and passing everything.

---

-- 3 Apr 2023 --

- Implemented jwt dependencies.
- Created controller and controller interface for login.
- Created ownerAuthDto.
- Created JWT Service and Jwt Service interface.
- Document where security config came from.
- Chain of actions so far
  - Hit controller and call service >> call generate token and pass username >> gen token calls create token >> create token sets the sign key, issues at, expires at, subject and claims.
- Currently returning a token through postman if creds correct.
- Have removed form login as we were mostly just receiving 302s for the spring redirect when hitting our endpoint for the login form.
- Currently receiving 403s though browser and postman.

---

-- 31 Mar 2023 --

- Repo will be updated after more work and potentially sensitive information in the code secured.

---

-- 30 Mar 2023 --

- Broke out owners-tools controllers and services to owners-tools/orders and owners-tools/customers.
- Further testing demonstrated an error in calculating daily sales.
  - Refactored DB from status column to closed column in order to replicate function of ready column. ie(default no and then when changed logs time).
  - Refactored method in orders repository to find order by closed.
  - Refactored close order method in OwnersOrdersService and daily sales method.
  - Updated logic of daily sales to reflect changes.

### Initial tests for owners functions pertaining to customers in place!

---

-- 29 Mar 2023 --

- Successful test for getting an order by id.
- Successful test for deleting an order by id.
- Functionality for owner to add a menu item to an order implemented.
- Functionality for owner to edit an item on an order implemented.
- Successful test for editing an item on an order.
- Successful test for adding an item to an order.
- Successful test for returning days sales and verifying the equal a summed total of orders
  marked closed in the db.

### Initial tests for owners functions pertaining to orders in place!

---

-- 28 Mar 2023 --

- Added verification clause to order created test by immediately retrieving the created order from db.
- Successful test for owners to retrieve an order by order uid.
- Successful test for owners to get all orders.
- Successful test for retrieving open orders by customer name.
- Successful test for marking an order ready.
- Successful test for marking an or order closed.
- Test case for marking an order closed exposed a bug where orders were unable to be called after being marked closed.
  As customer id field was null the requirements were unfilled for creating the necessary dto. This was fixed by setting a default null value for the
  fields of interest. If the incoming order has null for a customer id then there is no point in setting the fields and the requirements of the dto are satisfied.

---

-- 27 Mar 2023 --

- Determined means for obfuscating customer details.
- More time spent researching hashing data for owner auth will work on it more after initial tests successful with restructure.
- Refactored reflecting structure change and removed unnecessary tests though their frames may be utilized in future contexts.
- Menu item tests successful
- Order creation test successful.

---

=======

-- 21 Mar 2023 --

- Customer and order saved in same transaction.
- Customer may place an additional order while past order is still open, eliminating duplicate customer entries.
- Upon closing last open customer order, customer information removed. Ensures information not in use is not sitting idly waiting to be exploited.
- Began work on securing owners tools endpoint.
  - Created owners table and loaded sample data.
  - Created owner entity and respository.

---

=======

-- 20 Mar 2023 --

- Get customer dto refactored for the desired use case and function is currently operating as desired.
- Implemeneted returning a customer by customer name.
- Implemented returning a customer by id.
- Implemented updating a customers details.
- Implement customer delete a customer without deleting orders associated to them so that information can still be used for accounting purposes.

- Refactor notes:

  - Removed unused code and comments app wide due to relocation of functionality between order item, orders and owners.
  - Relocated order item dto converter to orders service.

- Began combining order and customer dto into a new order dto that more closely reflects what the order object will consist of.

- refactor notes
  → removed unused code and comments app wide due to relocation of functionality between order item, orders and owners
  → relocated order item dto converter to orders service

- Setting up dto for order response. Interested to see if this will solve recursion as we will be wanting to work with dto most likely anyways.
- Dto implemented and relationships currently behaving as expected.
- Next steps will include implementing tests, and reformatting database to include a column for status with a default value of open, and to be changed manually to closed after customer pays and picks up food by tons of tacos owners.

Not as far as I wanted to get today but I'll take the small victory.

- Created test for retrieving data and comparing it against an expected set of data.
- Also tested for proper response code from the query.

---

-- 26 Jan 2023 --

- Created a configuration that works for testing in memory as well as against the actual database.

Tomorrow's goals

- Try and complete means for full crud testing with in memory database.

---

-- 25 Jan 2023 --

- Revealed entity ids in order to aid in ease of working with data with method constructed in rest config
